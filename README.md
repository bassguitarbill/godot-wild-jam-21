## Unnamed Jam Game

Theme: **Connection**

### Ideas
- Electrician moving around with a grappling hook, connecting power together with other grappling hooks and such, trying not to get zapped
- Generic grappling hook sort of platformer
- Rainbow connection: banjos and rainbows and hopping between delightful clouds
- Connect different runes to cast spells
- Use a lasso
- Tether - connected worlds
- Ivy growing up a wall connecting the ground to ... something else?
- Rope cutting mechanic, severing connections

### Wildcards
- Make the game fun to speedrun
- Make the game juicy
- Make the game playable with two buttons

### And So
I like the idea of a grappling hook game playable with only two buttons. One button, you hold it down and prepare to shoot the grapple, holding it causes the angle to go from straight ahead, to overhead, to straight ahead on the other side. The other button could be used for other miscellaneous actions to get yourself unstuck, or a jump, or a gun, or a time slowdown, maybe double-pressing it could do something different. You'd grapple yourself to the exit, stepping on / grapple poking buttons and switches, and evading enemies, riding on moving platforms. Idk about making this juicy, but we could definitely hit the other two wildcards.
